2.1.1 GAME DESCRIPTION
The player will see a map of Europe without Streets + Cities (Only Country-borders). Its mission is to find the right location to the city name on this map. After placing the needle pin, the game will show you the right location of the city and the difference of your needle pin and the city in kilometres. If it is in around 50km of the city, the selection will be defined as "correct".

2.1.2 GAMES LOGIC
In the beginning, the player has a predetermined score of 1500 that symbolizes kilometres. At each round the difference between position of the city and your needle pin are reducing your score.

2.1.3 GAME END
The game ends when no kilometres are left. The high score is the amount of cities you have found.
